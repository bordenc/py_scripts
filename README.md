# Python Scripts

I'm self-learning Python. As should be obvious, I'm still very amateur at this level. This is where I dump scripts that I wrote to do odd jobs on my computer where I couldn't find suitable code to copy. The purpose of this repo is:

1. Help others who have similar problems not reinvent the proverbial wheel;
2. Solicit feedback and criticism on my code style. It would be great if some of these evolved into useful utilities; and
3. Practise using git.

Except where noted, scripts are independent of one another. That is, you can use one script without any others in this repo.

Scripts are minimally tested (happy for feedback there, too), and run on [Debian testing](https://packages.debian.org/testing/python/) with its python libraries. Non-Debian libraries have been imported from pip.
